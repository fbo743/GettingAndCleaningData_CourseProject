## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset - Code Book

### Data Origin
The data set is based on the work of Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. 
Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. 
International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

### Data Description
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

### Data Pre-processing
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Data Processing
The goal of the data transformations was to get a compact tidy table witch holds in each entry the average of each statistical measurement per subject per activity.
The final table should hold 180 entries (30 subjects * 6 activities).
The original data was merged into one united set out of testing and training sets. The identifiers of the subjects and the activities were added in the first columns.
Out of all the statistical measurements performed on all the variables in the original set only the mean and standard deviation were kept.

### Varisbles
The data set includes a total of 68 variables:
* Subject identifier (ranged 1-30)
* Activity type (one of: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
* mean and standard deviation for each one of the 33 features analyzed (values bounded within [-1,1])

#### Features
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
